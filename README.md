### How to Run our Software:

- First you will need to download the source code for our BEAR Bank software. You will be able to get this either from a downloadable .zip file, or you can download the source code from our public GitHub repository.
- Once you have downloaded the source code for our software, you can run the program in two different ways:
  - You can simply open the folder that you downloaded the software into, and double click on the executable file titled “ProjectMainFunctions”. Once you double click on this file, the terminal on your machine will open and the software will begin.
  - The manual way of running the software is to open your terminal and change your directory until you are in the folder that you downloaded the code into. Once you have reached the project folder, you will run the following command: “g++ ProjectMainFunctions”. After that command is ran, a new executable file will be opened in the folder and you can run this command “./a.out”. Once you run this command, the BEAR Bank software will be started on your machine.
